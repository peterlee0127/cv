I also designed API interfaces to allow other internal systems to hook up with our bot system.Up to now, it already bridged across our meeting reserve system and electronic bulletin board system.",

          "3: As a quick learner and contributor: I involved in many open source projects. Like Sandstorm(A open source private cloud with the container), Rocket.Chat(A open source chat app which like Slack). We have fixed many issues and add lots of features, and giving back to the community.",

          "4: Eager to learn everything: when I have free time, I like to think about how to make the system more efficient. I still find more possibility to improve the current system. Like the subtitle display system, I would like to let some part of the system can automatically work. Let the computer can label the people with their name in real-time and display the information on the subtitle. On the road of development, I fixed various issues and bugs of Tensorflow. NVIDIA give me an award as the outstanding community developer in this April."
