          My work is helping PDIS daily job, like internal tools or external website.
          One of my work is maintaining the RockChat.Chat continues to run in Sandstorm.
          To let the push notification pass Sandstorm gateway, I added powerbox request and fix package dependence.
          Another project like PDIS Line Bot is a Line chatbot. This bot support to query Tang's calendar data.
          Our member can get data just type some text.
          The data is stored in Microsoft Outlook server, I also developed a tool to query data from the server.
          This program sync data to generate API for other services. These programs also open source in our Github.
